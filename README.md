# Example Machine Learning Workflow

This is meant to be a demonstration of a workflow for a publicly available dataset. I adapted some tools I had developed for a proprietary project to perform similar analysis with a Kaggle dataset for red wine quality. The dataset is available here: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009

The demonstration is provided in the Jupyter notebook "exmaple_ml.ipynb". Simply click the file above to view a demonstration of data visualization and machine learning, with code and discussion provided.
